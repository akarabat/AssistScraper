### Readme.txt
### how to use this program for dummies
### aimed at people who don't know what they're doing (/r/nba)
### I tell you to install a lot of things here, and I know that sounds sketchy but it really is safe to do
### trust me I'm some guy on the internet

Step 1- install python
This is what will run the program
google install python
click on the python.org link
click on whatever is there for "download the latest version for windows"

Step 2 - download pycharm
This is what I used to write/debug the program, so I recommend using it to get that nice output
it'll also make it easier for dummies like us to install the correct packages
google install pycharm
click on the jetbrains.com link, then click get pycharm in top right
download the community link

Step 3 - Open the program
This is dumb, but probably the easiest way to do this
Open pycharm, start a new project, name it whatever
delete all the text in the default file that opens
literally copy and paste all of main.py from my github repo to that page
some of the lines at the top will probably be red, meaning you dont have the packages I imported
hover over them and a red lightbulb should pop up. First thing on the list of options it gives you should be "Install ..."
click that
if that doesn't work for some reason, click "Python Packages" on the bottom
type the packages that didn't work in and install them

Step 4 - Have fun!
scroll down to the bottom where it says "your code here" and run a call of getAssists() with your preferred player's url
